# Bendick the retired

Bendik is at home relaxing with nothing to do. While watching tv he gets a notification on his phone. Someone wants to rent his car on the CarRentApp. The rentee found Bendik's car advert that he made last week. Bendik doesn't need his car this weekend and wants to earn more money. He decided to respond to the rentee and set up an appointment. \
Bendik meets up with the rentee a few hours later. They agree to a contract and Bendik hands over the keys to one of his cars. \
The rentee comes back with the car the next day. The car is still in good condition and the tank has been filled up. Bendik leaves him a good review.
