# Robert the mechanic car enthusiast

Robert finally fixed one of his old veteran cars. He wants to rent it out as soon as possible. He opens the CarRentApp and enters "Renter mode". He clicks the "add new car" option to get started. Here he fills out the forms. For example license numbers etc., and adds photos of his beauty.

He saves his new car and looks over the new addition. He finds a spelling error. To fix this he presses "edit car". He fixes the error and saves again.

After creating the car, he wants to make the it available for rental. He sets the available hours for pickup, and max rental time. Before making it publicly available he sets an estimated price.
