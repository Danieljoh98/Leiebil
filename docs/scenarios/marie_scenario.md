# Marie Svenning the cashier in a big city

Marie has recently moved into a new apartment and needs more furniture. Today she wants to go to Ikea. She opens the CarRentApp and scrolls through possible cars. She sorts by type to find a car with sufficient space or with a till-hanger. She find a van that she likes and contacts the owner through the app. The owner responds and agrees for a short term rent.

She takes the bus over to where the rentee lives and the agree on a contract. She gets the keys and drives off to Ikea.

Marie finds so many lovely things at Ikea. She takes a long time and gets a bit delayed. She was supposed to hand back the car by 5 o'clock. This will not be possible, she finds out.

Marie opens the app to request an extension from the owner. The owner agrees. She moves all the new furniture into her new home. Hooray!

She returns the car within the extended time. They exchange keys and she agrees to pay a little extra for the extended time.
