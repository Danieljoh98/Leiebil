# Silje the lawyer

Silje wants to rent out her expensive car. She values the car a lot and wants a high rental price. She decided to enable dynamic pricing on her car advert.

With dynamic pricing enabled the car automatically adjusts the price depending on how long it has been since the last rental. A few days later a customer rents her car at a 20% discount.
