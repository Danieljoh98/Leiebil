# Student Kenneth Larsen

Kenneth is checking his fridge for groceries. Looking inside the fridge its low on meat, vegetables and soda. Then Kenneth had the great idea to go to Sweden to shop some cheaper food and save some money.

Kenneth then rents a car from the CarRentalApp. He then picks up the rented car that is in a walking distance away. For then to drive to Sweden where he buys all the food and drinks, he needs for the next two weeks. Then he drives back to his home and place all the food in his fridge. then he delivers back the rental car back to its owner.
